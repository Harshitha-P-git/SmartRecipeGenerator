## 🧠 Brief Write-Up (200 Words)
The **Smart Recipe Generator** is a web application designed to generate recipes based on available ingredients and dietary preferences.  
The frontend, built with React and Vite, provides a responsive interface where users can enter ingredients and instantly view matching recipes.  
The backend, developed using Flask, processes the user’s input and searches a database of 30 recipes that include ingredients, preparation steps, calories, difficulty level, and cooking time.  
The recipe-matching logic calculates the similarity between user-entered ingredients and recipe ingredients, ranking results accordingly.  
The application handles dietary restrictions by filtering vegetarian and non-vegetarian options.  
It also includes error handling and loading states to improve the user experience.  
The project demonstrates a complete full-stack workflow — frontend, backend, and deployment — using free hosting services such as **Netlify** (for the UI) and **Render** (for the backend API).  
This project highlights problem-solving ability, API integration, and production-quality implementation within the given time frame.
