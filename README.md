## 🧠 Brief Write-Up (200 Words)
**Smart Recipe Generator** is a web application developed to generate recipes based on user-provided ingredients and dietary preferences.  
The frontend, created using React (Vite), offers a modern and responsive interface where users can input ingredients, apply filters, and view matching recipes.  
The Flask-based backend processes the input and matches it against a predefined database of 30 recipes spanning multiple cuisines. Each recipe includes ingredients, preparation steps, calorie count, protein value, difficulty, and estimated cooking time.  
The system includes additional features like ingredient substitution suggestions, rating and favorite tracking, and personalized recipe recommendations based on user preferences.  
It also integrates error handling and loading indicators to enhance usability.  
The project showcases complete full-stack deployment using **Render** for the backend API and **Netlify** for the frontend.  
This application demonstrates practical problem-solving, API communication, and production-quality implementation, reflecting efficient design and user experience principles within the given time frame.
